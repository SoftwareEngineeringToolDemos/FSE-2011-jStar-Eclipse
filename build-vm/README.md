This document gives the steps for building the virtual machine for the tool by running vagrant scripts.
Firstly, download and install VirtualBox.
Next, download and install Vagrant.
Download this VagrantFile.
Then navigate to the directory containing this VagrantFile through the Command Prompt/Terminal.
Next, run the command "vagrant up" on command prompt/terminal.
This will boot up the Virtual Machine on VirtualBox, and will install Oracle Java 7 and Eclipse Mars.
Please note that installing eclipse can take some time.
To verify the version of Java installed, type "java -version" on the command prompt/terminal.
In case the Virtual Machine goes to sleep and the password is required, note that username is "vagrant" and password is also "vagrant".
